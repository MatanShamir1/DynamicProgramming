# DynamicProgramming
In this repository, I wrote a simple C++ application with some implementations of known dynamic programming problems, using C++ procedural programming.
### Problems included so far:
1. LCS
2. Minimum squares to combine a given integer
### What should I do to run the app?
1. Install Git and MinGW Compiler on your OS.
2. Open Git Bash and clone this repository:
3. 
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/MatanShamir1/DynamicProgramming.git
    ```
3. Enter the repository directory with git bash/Terminal/CMD.
4. Write the following command in order to compile the program and write the output to an executable file named Dynamic_Programming.exe
    ```
    $ g++ -o Dynamic_Programming DynamicProgramming.cpp DynamicProgramming.h main.cpp
    ```
5.(Only if you have a Linux system) enter the next command in order to make the executable accessible:

    ```
    $ chmod +x Dynamic_Programming
    ```
6.Run the program:

    ```
    $ ./Dynamic_Programming
    ```
The menu will be opened and guide you for the rest of the procedure.
